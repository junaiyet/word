   <div class="pb-4"></div>


   <p class="text">Health economic models are being developed and used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PBM. In a recent systemic review and meta-analysis, PBM implementation was reported to be associated with reduced RBC use and length of stay. Mean cost for transfusion per patient reduced from € 68.62 (Pre-PBM) to €32.41 (Post-PBM) (savings: €36.21). Overall savings accounted to €150.64 per patient. The Monte Carlo simulation (repeated random sampling for calculation) demonstrated distribution of cost-savings from € -253.01 to € -31.46 and a mean value of € -150.63 (95% CI: -200.75; -100.45). In this simulation, the total cost savings were € 1,878,000 in 100,000 simulated patients  <a class="toclink" href="Meybohm_et_al_2020">(Meybohm et al., 2020).</a> Kleinerüschkamp et al. performed a cost-analysis to assess the clinical and economic impact of PBM implementation. In the simulation model comprising of 10,000 patients, PBM, including restrictive transfusion strategy, was related to reduced total complication rate and deaths in both non-cardiac (17.68% and 4.11% deaths, respectively) and cardiac surgery (12.45% and 3.04%, respectively) patients. Cost-savings per avoided complication were € 16,318.79 for non-cardiac and €14,139.04 for cardiac surgery patients <a class="toclink" href="Kleineruschkamp_Meybohm_Straub_Zacharowski_&_Choorapoikayil_2019">(Kleineruschkamp, Meybohm, Straub, Zacharowski, & Choorapoikayil, 2019).</a> In other study by Munoz et al., a cost-analysis in 182 patients with total lower limb arthroplasty revealed reduced transfusion and no incremental costs <a class="toclink" href="Munoz_et_al_2014">(Munoz et al., 2014).</a> Tranexamic acid administration was associated with reduced blood transfusions in 198 patients undergoing arthroplasty interventions and reduced costs (mean savings: €138 per patient).
    PBM program introduction in Western Australia reported 41% reduction in blood products utilization and decrease in in-hospital mortality (28%; P <0.001), mean length of stay (15%; P <0.001). Product-acquisition cost savings accounted to Australian Dollar, AUD 18.5 million <a class="toclink" href="Leahy_et_al_2017">(Leahy et al., 2017).</a>
