   <div class="pb-4"></div>


   <p class="text">Donabedian quality framework is a quality improvement model used in public healthcare settings, and is based on three approaches namely, structure, process, and outcome (Figure 6). Donabedian model refers outcomes as ‘ultimate validators’ as they determine the effectiveness and quality of healthcare, and process as measures of quality  <a class="toclink" href="NHS">(NHS).</a>IFor a patient-centric health system, the quality of outcome should define the quality of structure and process <a class="toclink" href="Hofmann_A_et_al_2017">(Hofmann A et al., 2017).</a>

   <p class="text">Application of the Donabedian framework can help identify gaps and areas of improvement that may limit the establishment of PBM as standard of care. These may include lack of awareness and/or education in the stakeholders, professionals or patients, lack of information about the risks involved with anemia, bleeding disorders, etc., lack of prioritizing the PBM implementation, uncoordinated patient care, lack of a proper PBM benchmarking, analytics, and reporting system, and so on. Figure 7 gives the essentials of a quality framework  <a class="toclink" href="Hofmann_A_et_al_2017">(Hofmann A et al., 2017).</a>
