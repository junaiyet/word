  <p class="text">In the coming decades, the acceleration and advancement of biomedical discoveries will bring upon an era where the economic resources for health care will gradually decrease and come to an end.

  <p class="doctitle ">Blood Transfusions and Associated Complications</p>
  <div class="pb-4"></div>
  <p class="text">Blood transfusions have proven to be life-saving procedure and made complicated surgical treatment possible. It has been widely used since the early 20th century to treat anemia and hemorrhage. Transfusion has been overused and continues to be excessively used in the face of limited availability of blood and serious adverse events involved. <a class="toclink" href="Yaddanapudi_&_Yaddanapudi_2014">(Yaddanapudi & Yaddanapudi, 2014)</a>Blood transfusion are associated with complications such as increased risk of infections, myocardial infarction, transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), postoperative morbidity, increased early and late mortality <a class="toclink" href="Bernard_Davenport_Chang_Vaughan_&_Zwischenberger_2009_Gombotz_2012_G_J_Murphy_et_al._2007">(Bernard, Davenport, Chang, Vaughan, & Zwischenberger, 2009; Gombotz, 2012; G. J. Murphy et al., 2007)</a>(Bernard, Davenport, Chang, Vaughan, & Zwischenberger, 2009; Gombotz, 2012; G. J. Murphy et al., 2007). Hence, the decision-making for administration of blood depends on analyzing risks and potential benefits of blood transfusion against those for anemia.
   Figure 3 demonstrates the risk factors associated with blood transfusions performed in anemic and iron-deficient patients.

<p class="doctitle ">Preoperative Anemia: An Independent Risk Factor for Blood Transfusions</p>
<div class="pb-4"></div>
<p class="text">The use of allogenic blood products because of preoperative anemia may lead to higher mortality and morbidity in various patient groups  <a class="toclink" href="Butcher_&_Richards_2018_Marik_&_Corwin_2008">(Butcher & Richards, 2018; Marik & Corwin, 2008)</a>. Preoperative anemia was independently associated with an increased risk of 30-day morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery in a study by Musallam et al. (odds ratio [OR] 1.42, 95% CI 1.31-1.54) <a class="toclink" href="Musallam_et_al_2011">(Musallam et al., 2011)</a>. 
 In another study, 30-day mortality was higher in patients with preoperative anemia (3.2%) than those without preoperative anemia (1.6%, OR unadjusted 1.98, 95% CI: 1.56–2.51, P<0.001). Also, preoperatively anemic patients were 21% more likely to develop major morbidity within 30 days than those without preoperative anemia (OR adjusted 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09–1.33) <a class="toclink" href=" (Tohme_Varley_Landsittel_Chidi_&_Tsung_2016). ">( (Tohme, Varley, Landsittel, Chidi, & Tsung, 2016). </a>Thus, allogenic blood transfusion (ABT) is itself considered to be an independent risk factor for poor clinical conditions.
 A detailed account of preoperative anemia, bleeding risks and transfusions and resulting complications has been covered in the Clinician Module of this Patient Blood Management Toolkit.

<span class="subtitle">Burden of Cost of Blood Transfusions in Preoperative Anemia Management</span>
<p class="text">Another huge disadvantage associated with ABTs is the associated high costs. The processing, screening, conservation and distribution costs and administration costs are high. The adverse outcomes, prolonged length of hospital stays, and increased blood transfusion frequency ultimately leads to increased direct and indirect healthcare costs <a class="toclink" href="Baron_et_al_2014_Burton_et_al_2018">(Baron et al., 2014; Burton et al., 2018)</a>.

<p class="text">A systematic review estimated the cost of a two-unit packed RBC transfusion in western Europe is around Euros (€) 877.69 <a class="toclink" href="Abraham_&_Sun_2012">69 (Abraham & Sun, 2012))</a>. An estimated blood administration annual cost in United Kingdom National Health Service was found to be exceeding 120 million Pounds (£), excluding the blood products <a class="toclink" href="Stokes_et_al_2018">(Stokes et al., 2018)</a>. Shander et al. (2010) estimated cost of packed unit of RBCs at four hospitals in United States using activity-based model (ABC) constructed by the Cost of Blood Consensus Conference (COBCON). The total cost per unit was $760.82 ± $293.74 (mean ± standard deviation [SD]), which varied depending on the hospitals participating. Total RBC unit costs were 3.2 to 4.8-folds greater than the cost of blood product acquisition. The acquisition costs only 21-32% of transfusion-related expenditures. Figure 4 shows the total ABC model cost and acquisition cost at each of the four hospitals. This study confirmed that the cost per unit of RBC vary across healthcare settings and geographies<a class="toclink" href=" Shander_et_al_2010"> (Shander et al., 2010)</a>.

<p>Another study by Purvis et al analyzed the economics of liberal transfusion (intraoperative hemoglobin [Hb] level: ≥10 g/dL and postoperative Hb level: ≥8 g/dL) in spine surgery patients. The total costs of packed RBC transfusion were estimated to be between $2,268,079 and $7,835,182 in approximately 6.6 years. The overall cost associated with liberal transfusion was between $1,330,439 and $4,596,062<a class="toclink" href="Purvis_et_al_2017">(Purvis et al., 2017). </a>  
Blood transfusions constitute the major proportion of expenses in the healthcare system. Improved financing and judicious use of blood components and services is a mandate <a class="toclink" href="Oge_Kilic_&_Kilic_2014">(Oge, Kilic, & Kilic, 2014).</a>  The concept of patient blood management (PBM) was introduced to address the increased incidence of preoperative anemia associated with adverse outcomes, higher occurrence of infections, prolonged hospital stays, increased frequency of blood transfusions, and higher healthcare costs <a class="toclink" href="Baron_et_al_2020_Shander_et_al_2020">(Baron et al., 2020; Shander et al., 2020). </a> PBM is a new standard of care to significantly improve outcomes and reduce costs.

<p class="text">The World Health Organization (WHO) defines PBM as an “evidence-based, patient-focused, systematic approach to optimize patient management, transfusion of blood, reduce perioperative blood losses and increase tolerance of physiological anemia”  <a class="toclink" href="WHO_2011a">(WHO, 2011a).</a>. PBM focuses on a three-pillar strategy (Figure 5) and includes measures to avoid unnecessary blood transfusion (anemia management, cell salvage, anti-fibrinolytic drugs) and ensures that the patients receive optimal treatment and rationalize the judicious use of blood products  <a class="toclink" href="M._Murphy_&_Goodnough_2015">(M.

<span class="subtitle" style="font-style: italic;">Key Performance Indicators for Successful PBM Programs</span>

<p class="text">For ensuring a successful implementation and functioning of PBM, monitoring and surveying of evaluation tools or key performance indicators (KPIs) is recommended. EU Optimum Blood Use has included quality (internal and external), structural, process and outcome indicators to evaluate the transfusion practices (EU, 2015). Scotland’s Better Blood Transfusion guidelines performance was assessed based on measures such as staff training, amount of blood transfused and number of transfusions. Later, they employed new methods to evaluate performance based on a matrix scoring system which included training, transfusion incidents and blood wastage <a class="toclink" href="Dalrymple_&_Watson_2014">(Dalrymple & Watson, 2014). </a> 
</p>
<p class="text">
WA PBMP assessed the impact of PBM program implementation on key outcome measures in four metropolitan tertiary hospitals. They elected 5 primary key program-performance indicators and 4 primary hospital-wide patient outcome measures. Performance indicators selected included:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="mt-4 mb-4">
 Mean RBC, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelet units transfused per patient discharge
