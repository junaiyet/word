   <p class="text">Blood transfusions have been extensively used but limited availability of blood, associated complications such as increased morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and high costs are the major concerns. Health-system-wide PBM implementation is considered to be a new holistic tool for improved standard of care to significantly contribute to improved clinical outcomes and reduced expenses. Several global health systems have implied successful PBM programs to shift the focus of transfusion medicine from blood products to patients.
    This Business Module summarizes the key elements and models crucial for implementation and performance of PBM programs. It entails the requirements of a successful business case proposal and implementation plans.
    PBM success is subject to continuous evolution and further randomized controlled trials are required to optimize and support the PBM approach in both surgical and non-surgical patients.
