    <p class="text">In the coming decades, the acceleration and advancement of biomedical discoveries will bring upon an era where the economic resources for health care will gradually decrease and come to an end. The aim of future medicine will be efficient use of resources in order to prevent diseases, with an objective of delivering the best care to patient who needs treatment <a class="toclink" href="Kohane_Drazen_&_Campion_2012">(Kohane, Drazen, & Campion, 2012)</a>.</p>
  
    <p class="doctitle ">Blood Transfusions and Associated Complications</p>
    <div class="pb-4"></div>
    <p class="text">Blood transfusions have proven to be life-saving procedure and made complicated surgical treatment possible. It has been widely used since the early 20th century to treat anemia and hemorrhage. Transfusion has been overused and continues to be excessively used in the face of limited availability of blood and serious adverse events involved. <a class="toclink" href="Yaddanapudi_&_Yaddanapudi_2014">(Yaddanapudi & Yaddanapudi, 2014)</a>Blood transfusion are associated with complications such as increased risk of infections, myocardial infarction, transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), postoperative morbidity, increased early and late mortality <a class="toclink" href="Bernard_Davenport_Chang_Vaughan_&_Zwischenberger_2009_Gombotz_2012_G_J_Murphy_et_al._2007">(Bernard, Davenport, Chang, Vaughan, & Zwischenberger, 2009; Gombotz, 2012; G. J. Murphy et al., 2007)</a>(Bernard, Davenport, Chang, Vaughan, & Zwischenberger, 2009; Gombotz, 2012; G. J. Murphy et al., 2007). Hence, the decision-making for administration of blood depends on analyzing risks and potential benefits of blood transfusion against those for anemia.
     Figure 3 demonstrates the risk factors associated with blood transfusions performed in anemic and iron-deficient patients. Table 1 enlists the transfusion related complications reported by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the financial year 2014 –2018 <a class="toclink" href="Food_and_Drug_Administration_2018"> (Food and Drug Administration, 2018)</a>.</p>

  <p class="doctitle ">Preoperative Anemia: An Independent Risk Factor for Blood Transfusions</p>
  <div class="pb-4"></div>
  <p class="text">The use of allogenic blood products because of preoperative anemia may lead to higher mortality and morbidity in various patient groups  <a class="toclink" href="Butcher_&_Richards_2018_Marik_&_Corwin_2008">(Butcher & Richards, 2018; Marik & Corwin, 2008)</a>. Preoperative anemia was independently associated with an increased risk of 30-day morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery in a study by Musallam et al. (odds ratio [OR] 1.42, 95% CI 1.31-1.54) <a class="toclink" href="Musallam_et_al_2011">(Musallam et al., 2011)</a>. 
   In another study, 30-day mortality was higher in patients with preoperative anemia (3.2%) than those without preoperative anemia (1.6%, OR unadjusted 1.98, 95% CI: 1.56–2.51, P<0.001). Also, preoperatively anemic patients were 21% more likely to develop major morbidity within 30 days than those without preoperative anemia (OR adjusted 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09–1.33) <a class="toclink" href=" (Tohme_Varley_Landsittel_Chidi_&_Tsung_2016). ">( (Tohme, Varley, Landsittel, Chidi, & Tsung, 2016). </a>Thus, allogenic blood transfusion (ABT) is itself considered to be an independent risk factor for poor clinical conditions.
   A detailed account of preoperative anemia, bleeding risks and transfusions and resulting complications has been covered in the Clinician Module of this Patient Blood Management Toolkit.

  <span class="subtitle">Burden of Cost of Blood Transfusions in Preoperative Anemia Management</span>
  <p class="text">Another huge disadvantage associated with ABTs is the associated high costs. The processing, screening, conservation and distribution costs and administration costs are high. The adverse outcomes, prolonged length of hospital stays, and increased blood transfusion frequency ultimately leads to increased direct and indirect healthcare costs <a class="toclink" href="Baron_et_al_2014_Burton_et_al_2018">(Baron et al., 2014; Burton et al., 2018)</a>. In one study, 945 cardiac surgery patients, the length of ICU stay and total days of hospitalization from surgery to discharge were higher in patients receiving RBC is the first 24 hours postoperatively <a class="toclink" href="Mohnle_et_al_2011">(Mohnle et al., 2011)</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="text">A systematic review estimated the cost of a two-unit packed RBC transfusion in western Europe is around Euros (€) 877.69 <a class="toclink" href="Abraham_&_Sun_2012">69 (Abraham & Sun, 2012))</a>. An estimated blood administration annual cost in United Kingdom National Health Service was found to be exceeding 120 million Pounds (£), excluding the blood products <a class="toclink" href="Stokes_et_al_2018">(Stokes et al., 2018)</a>. Shander et al. (2010) estimated cost of packed unit of RBCs at four hospitals in United States using activity-based model (ABC) constructed by the Cost of Blood Consensus Conference (COBCON). The total cost per unit was $760.82 ± $293.74 (mean ± standard deviation [SD]), which varied depending on the hospitals participating. Total RBC unit costs were 3.2 to 4.8-folds greater than the cost of blood product acquisition. The acquisition costs only 21-32% of transfusion-related expenditures. Figure 4 shows the total ABC model cost and acquisition cost at each of the four hospitals. This study confirmed that the cost per unit of RBC vary across healthcare settings and geographies<a class="toclink" href=" Shander_et_al_2010"> (Shander et al., 2010)</a>.

  <p>Another study by Purvis et al analyzed the economics of liberal transfusion (intraoperative hemoglobin [Hb] level: ≥10 g/dL and postoperative Hb level: ≥8 g/dL) in spine surgery patients. The total costs of packed RBC transfusion were estimated to be between $2,268,079 and $7,835,182 in approximately 6.6 years. The overall cost associated with liberal transfusion was between $1,330,439 and $4,596,062<a class="toclink" href="Purvis_et_al_2017">(Purvis et al., 2017). </a>  
  Blood transfusions constitute the major proportion of expenses in the healthcare system. Improved financing and judicious use of blood components and services is a mandate <a class="toclink" href="Oge_Kilic_&_Kilic_2014">(Oge, Kilic, & Kilic, 2014).</a>  The concept of patient blood management (PBM) was introduced to address the increased incidence of preoperative anemia associated with adverse outcomes, higher occurrence of infections, prolonged hospital stays, increased frequency of blood transfusions, and higher healthcare costs <a class="toclink" href="Baron_et_al_2020_Shander_et_al_2020">(Baron et al., 2020; Shander et al., 2020). </a> PBM is a new standard of care to significantly improve outcomes and reduce costs.

  <p class="text">For ensuring a successful implementation and functioning of PBM, monitoring and surveying of evaluation tools or key performance indicators (KPIs) is recommended. EU Optimum Blood Use has included quality (internal and external), structural, process and outcome indicators to evaluate the transfusion practices (EU, 2015). Scotland’s Better Blood Transfusion guidelines performance was assessed based on measures such as staff training, amount of blood transfused and number of transfusions. Later, they employed new methods to evaluate performance based on a matrix scoring system which included training, transfusion incidents and blood wastage <a class="toclink" href="Dalrymple_&_Watson_2014">(Dalrymple & Watson, 2014). </a>

  <h1 style="color: rgb(2, 175, 255);">Health Economic Models for PBM Implementation: A Cost-benefit Analysis </h1>
 <div class="pb-4"></div>


 <p class="text">Health economic models are being developed and used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PBM. In a recent systemic review and meta-analysis, PBM implementation was reported to be associated with reduced RBC use and length of stay. Mean cost for transfusion per patient reduced from € 68.62 (Pre-PBM) to €32.41 (Post-PBM) (savings: €36.21). Overall savings accounted to €150.64 per patient. The Monte Carlo simulation (repeated random sampling for calculation) demonstrated distribution of cost-savings from € -253.01 to € -31.46 and a mean value of € -150.63 (95% CI: -200.75; -100.45). In this simulation, the total cost savings were € 1,878,000 in 100,000 simulated patients  <a class="toclink" href="Meybohm_et_al_2020">(Meybohm et al., 2020).</a> Kleinerüschkamp et al. performed a cost-analysis to assess the clinical and economic impact of PBM implementation. In the simulation model comprising of 10,000 patients, PBM, including restrictive transfusion strategy, was related to reduced total complication rate and deaths in both non-cardiac (17.68% and 4.11% deaths, respectively) and cardiac surgery (12.45% and 3.04%, respectively) patients. Cost-savings per avoided complication were € 16,318.79 for non-cardiac and €14,139.04 for cardiac surgery patients <a class="toclink" href="Kleineruschkamp_Meybohm_Straub_Zacharowski_&_Choorapoikayil_2019">(Kleineruschkamp, Meybohm, Straub, Zacharowski, & Choorapoikayil, 2019).</a> In other study by Munoz et al., a cost-analysis in 182 patients with total lower limb arthroplasty revealed reduced transfusion and no incremental costs <a class="toclink" href="Munoz_et_al_2014">(Munoz et al., 2014).</a> Tranexamic acid administration was associated with reduced blood transfusions in 198 patients undergoing arthroplasty interventions and reduced costs (mean savings: €138 per patient).
  PBM program introduction in Western Australia reported 41% reduction in blood products utilization and decrease in in-hospital mortality (28%; P <0.001), mean length of stay (15%; P <0.001). Product-acquisition cost savings accounted to Australian Dollar, AUD 18.5 million <a class="toclink" href="Leahy_et_al_2017">(Leahy et al., 2017).</a>

  <h1 style="color: rgb(2, 175, 255);">Building a Business Case for Implementing a Successful PBM Program <span style="font-size: 16px; display: block;">
    (Derderian, 2004, AABB, 2015)
  </span>  </h1>


 <div class="pb-4"></div>


 <p class="text">A business model or case is a tool to design a plan that enlists limitations and important operational parameters for a business plan. A well-crafted business plan is a fundamental step to build an interdepartmental consensus around the goals of a program, for clinical staff to advocate improved transfusion-related quality of care and patient safety, and to evaluate potential financial benefits.
   
   
</p>
<p class="text">A business case focuses on five key requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="mt-4 mb-4">Introduction to PBM</li>
  <li class="mb-4">Rationale for PBM</li>
  <li class="mb-4">Need of education (key stakeholders)</li>
  <li class="mb-4">Actions required</li>
  <li class="mb-4">Associated costs and benefits</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">A business plan should be a written proposal including an introduction, purpose, objectives or benefits, approach and alternatives, performance measures, a risk-benefit profiling an operations plan, and financial analysis.</p>
<p class="doctitle">Introduction</p>
<p class="text">An introduction in the preliminary proposal includes the history of blood transfusion and its efficacy and discussion on current trends. </p>
<p class="doctitle">Mission Statement/Business Purpose</p>
<p class="text">A program statement is directly tied to the issues, needs and opportunities. PBM is defined both for in-hospital blood conservation as well as a marketing tool for the public. A model introduction should define blood conservation from patient’s care perspectives and needs. It addresses the basic requirements of the program including capital and noncapital expenses, educational needs, and administrative support.</p>
<p class="doctitle">Objectives/Benefits</p>
<p class="text">The objectives of any plan should define detailed, quantifiable goals for the program. It should include the baseline data, current gaps and situation, targets, medical records and review, benchmarking data (internal and external), inventories, billing and budgeting, morbidity and mortality data and statements from key stakeholders.</p>

<p class="doctitle">Preferred Approach and Alternate Solutions</p>
<p class="text">This part of the business model should include the predefined best suitable solution and approaches to meet the objectives. Alternative approaches along with discussion on why the selected solution is preferred can also be defined to bring in reasonable objections from their analysis and assessments.</p>

<p class="doctitle">Performance and Progress Measures</p>
<p class="text">Certain measurable improvements and their evaluation in the model stage can disclose PBM shortcomings and identify prospects for savings. Thus, metrics to measure the program performance should be defined under this section. Important PBM metrics may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="mt-4 mb-4">Overall transfusion rate compared to that of other hospitals</li>
  <li class=" mb-4">Transfusion rates in specific cases/surgeries compared to data from literature</li>
  <li class=" mb-4">Record of transfusions outside of hospital or professional transfusion recommendations</li>
  <li class=" mb-4">Transfusion administration compliance</li>
  <li class=" mb-4">Transfusion adverse reaction rates</li>
</ul>
<p class="doctitle">Risks Involved and Mitigation</p>
<p class="text">Risk and benefits analysis evaluate risks and potential challenges in the implementation of the program. Programs like PBM yield a net positive effect on the cost returns as well as improved patient outcomes but may have few risks associated with them. This can include alienation of members of staff involved, non or underperformance of key stakeholders or other failures. SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) can identify implementation risks involved and help develop reasonable mechanisms to mitigate the challenges with support from internal stakeholders.</p>
<p class="doctitle">Operational Plan and Timelines</p>
<p class="text">A formal program plan should enlist major activities, required staff resources and an estimated timeline with important milestones for the deliverables stated. The timelines are the expected time needed to implement a PBM program and can be represented using Gantt charts (bar charts). Additionally, this process will require a quality staff who are experts in project management, know the design and can help in identifying required data for a successful business case.
  The other crucial step involves defining roles and laying out the starting and the endpoints for the program. Table 2 illustrates the layout of a formal operation plan for a hospital’s PBM program.

    <li class=" mb-3">Use advanced educational strategies to enhance the function of the program
     </li>
  
  </ul>
</div>

<p class="doctitle">Financial analysis and Funding Sources</p>
<p class="text">Financial analysis or a detailed program budget is a fundamental aspect of a formal business case that involves defining the cost estimates and funding sources. It should identify budget that comprises of initial project costs (salaries, equipment needs and any resources) and ongoing project costs. Essentially, this is performed by a finance expertise or internal finance support team.
  </p>
<p class="text">PBM-related cost savings should be estimated and can be categorized as hard or soft. The preference is to use historical trends in blood utilization, cost of purchase of blood and blood products, and costs required to prepare blood products for transfusion. Capital and noncapital costs can then be used to extrapolate different scenarios.
  Finding resources to fund the program is challenging due to limited hospital and healthcare resources. Alternative funding sources should be considered to initiate a program. PBM program may result into cost savings but starting one needs an initial small investment. Return on investment (ROI), a calculator to evaluate efficiency of an investment, is used in order to evaluate the program’s efficiency.

    <p class="text">Transfusion Economics</p>
    <p class="doctitle">Financial analysis and Funding Sources</p>
    <p class="text">Transfusion-associated costs include the cost of labor, processing and supplies for storage, testing, administering, and monitoring blood products. These are the direct variable costs which can be quantified.
      The bulk of transfusion economics other than analysis of all direct and indirect overhead costs of blood transfusions includes adverse event costs that cover hospital-acquired infections, increased length of stay, and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). Cost of adverse events can increase drastically but can be avoided by practicing safer transfusion.

</p>

<p class="doctitle ">Development of PBM Reimbursement Schemes</p>
<p class="text">The PBM treatment approach is generally for the hospitalized patients and the related costs are covered or reimbursed by the public health insurance system. Some PBM modalities may pose certain restrictions around adequate reimbursements in some health systems. For instance, management of preoperative anemia is planned several days prior to the intended elective surgery. However, any treatment or measure performed prior to several days before actual hospitalization may not be covered under the reimbursement plan by the public health insurance. Thus, to overcome this disparity, all PBM services should be integrated with appropriate reimbursement schemes. the responsibility of planning and managing these financial requirements is carried out by the task force under the guidance and supervision of PBM Steering Committee including clinical experts, hospital administrators and public health insurance party <a class="toclink" href="Hofmann_A_et_al_2017_Shander_et_al_2012)">(Hofmann A et al., 2017; Shander et al., 2012) .</a>

<div class="pb-5"></div>







  <h1 style="color: rgb(2, 175, 255);">Conclusionm</h1>

  <div class="mt-3"></div>



 <p class="text">Blood transfusions have been extensively used but limited availability of blood, associated complications such as increased morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and high costs are the major concerns. Health-system-wide PBM implementation is considered to be a new holistic tool for improved standard of care to significantly contribute to improved clinical outcomes and reduced expenses. Several global health systems have implied successful PBM programs to shift the focus of transfusion medicine from blood products to patients.
  This Business Module summarizes the key elements and models crucial for implementation and performance of PBM programs. It entails the requirements of a successful business case proposal and implementation plans.
  PBM success is subject to continuous evolution and further randomized controlled trials are required to optimize and support the PBM approach in both surgical and non-surgical patients.
