    <h1 style="color: rgb(2, 175, 255);">Building a Business Case for Implementing a Successful PBM Program <span style="font-size: 16px; display: block;">
      (Derderian, 2004, AABB, 2015)
    </span>  </h1>


   <div class="pb-4"></div>


   <p class="text">A business model or case is a tool to design a plan that enlists limitations and important operational parameters for a business plan. A well-crafted business plan is a fundamental step to build an interdepartmental consensus around the goals of a program, for clinical staff to advocate improved transfusion-related quality of care and patient safety, and to evaluate potential financial benefits.
     
     
  </p>
  <p class="text">A business case focuses on five key requirements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="mt-4 mb-4">Introduction to PBM</li>
    <li class="mb-4">Rationale for PBM</li>
    <li class="mb-4">Need of education (key stakeholders)</li>
    <li class="mb-4">Actions required</li>
    <li class="mb-4">Associated costs and benefits</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text">A business plan should be a written proposal including an introduction, purpose, objectives or benefits, approach and alternatives, performance measures, a risk-benefit profiling an operations plan, and financial analysis.</p>
  <p class="doctitle">Introduction</p>
  <p class="text">An introduction in the preliminary proposal includes the history of blood transfusion and its efficacy and discussion on current trends. </p>
  <p class="doctitle">Mission Statement/Business Purpose</p>
  <p class="text">A program statement is directly tied to the issues, needs and opportunities. PBM is defined both for in-hospital blood conservation as well as a marketing tool for the public. A model introduction should define blood conservation from patient’s care perspectives and needs. It addresses the basic requirements of the program including capital and noncapital expenses, educational needs, and administrative support.</p>
  <p class="doctitle">Objectives/Benefits</p>
  <p class="text">The objectives of any plan should define detailed, quantifiable goals for the program. It should include the baseline data, current gaps and situation, targets, medical records and review, benchmarking data (internal and external), inventories, billing and budgeting, morbidity and mortality data and statements from key stakeholders.</p>
  
  <p class="doctitle">Preferred Approach and Alternate Solutions</p>
  <p class="text">This part of the business model should include the predefined best suitable solution and approaches to meet the objectives. Alternative approaches along with discussion on why the selected solution is preferred can also be defined to bring in reasonable objections from their analysis and assessments.</p>
  
  <p class="doctitle">Performance and Progress Measures</p>
  <p class="text">Certain measurable improvements and their evaluation in the model stage can disclose PBM shortcomings and identify prospects for savings. Thus, metrics to measure the program performance should be defined under this section. Important PBM metrics may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="mt-4 mb-4">Overall transfusion rate compared to that of other hospitals</li>
    <li class=" mb-4">Transfusion rates in specific cases/surgeries compared to data from literature</li>
    <li class=" mb-4">Record of transfusions outside of hospital or professional transfusion recommendations</li>
    <li class=" mb-4">Transfusion administration compliance</li>
    <li class=" mb-4">Transfusion adverse reaction rates</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="doctitle">Risks Involved and Mitigation</p>
  <p class="text">Risk and benefits analysis evaluate risks and potential challenges in the implementation of the program. Programs like PBM yield a net positive effect on the cost returns as well as improved patient outcomes but may have few risks associated with them. This can include alienation of members of staff involved, non or underperformance of key stakeholders or other failures. SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) can identify implementation risks involved and help develop reasonable mechanisms to mitigate the challenges with support from internal stakeholders.</p>
  <p class="doctitle">Operational Plan and Timelines</p>
  <p class="text">A formal program plan should enlist major activities, required staff resources and an estimated timeline with important milestones for the deliverables stated. The timelines are the expected time needed to implement a PBM program and can be represented using Gantt charts (bar charts). Additionally, this process will require a quality staff who are experts in project management, know the design and can help in identifying required data for a successful business case.
    The other crucial step involves defining roles and laying out the starting and the endpoints for the program. Table 2 illustrates the layout of a formal operation plan for a hospital’s PBM program.

       </li>
    
    </ul>

  <p class="doctitle">Financial analysis and Funding Sources</p>
  <p class="text">Financial analysis or a detailed program budget is a fundamental aspect of a formal business case that involves defining the cost estimates and funding sources. It should identify budget that comprises of initial project costs (salaries, equipment needs and any resources) and ongoing project costs. Essentially, this is performed by a finance expertise or internal finance support team.
    </p>
  <p class="text">PBM-related cost savings should be estimated and can be categorized as hard or soft. The preference is to use historical trends in blood utilization, cost of purchase of blood and blood products, and costs required to prepare blood products for transfusion. Capital and noncapital costs can then be used to extrapolate different scenarios.
    Finding resources to fund the program is challenging due to limited hospital and healthcare resources. Alternative funding sources should be considered to initiate a program. PBM program may result into cost savings but starting one needs an initial small investment. Return on investment (ROI), a calculator to evaluate efficiency of an investment, is used in order to evaluate the program’s efficiency.

      <p class="text">Transfusion Economics</p>
      <p class="doctitle">Financial analysis and Funding Sources</p>
      <p class="text">Transfusion-associated costs include the cost of labor, processing and supplies for storage, testing, administering, and monitoring blood products. These are the direct variable costs which can be quantified.
        The bulk of transfusion economics other than analysis of all direct and indirect overhead costs of blood transfusions includes adverse event costs that cover hospital-acquired infections, increased length of stay, and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). Cost of adverse events can increase drastically but can be avoided by practicing safer transfusion.
